# CSE 208: Data Structures and Algorithms II Sessional

This repository contains all home and lab assignments for the **CSE 208: Data Structures and Algorithms II Sessional** course, part of the Term-2, Level-2 curriculum at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). The course emphasizes applying theories from **CSE 207: Data Structures and Algorithms II** to practical problem-solving and the creation of data structures.

## Course Overview

**CSE 208** is a 1.50 credit hour sessional course intended for Level 2 Term 2 students. It serves as a practical extension of **CSE 207**, allowing students to apply theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to various assignments and practice materials:

- **Offline**: Contains offline assignments focusing on specific data structures and algorithms.
- **Online**: Includes code and solutions developed during lab sessions, emphasizing real-time problem-solving.
- **Practice**: Provides additional practice problems and their implementations to reinforce understanding of the course material.

## Implemented Topics

The course covers a range of advanced data structures and algorithms, including:

- **Binary Search Trees**: Implementation and analysis of binary search trees for efficient data retrieval.
- **Heaps**: Design and utilization of heap structures for priority queue operations.
- **Max Flow Algorithms**: Algorithms to determine the maximum flow in a flow network.
- **Branch and Bound**: Techniques for solving combinatorial optimization problems.
- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Implementation of algorithms like Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford for finding shortest paths in graphs.
- **Fibonacci Trees**: Study and implementation of Fibonacci heaps for optimized heap operations.

## Prerequisites

Students are expected to have completed **CSE 207: Data Structures and Algorithms II**, which provides the theoretical foundation for this sessional course.

## Contributors

The assignments and projects in this repository were developed by Shahriar Raj as part of the CSE 208 course at BUET.

## Acknowledgments

We extend our gratitude to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at BUET for providing the resources and guidance necessary for completing this course.
